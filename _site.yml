title: "Who is into Green Infrastructure?"
author: Sun Ho Hwang
subtititle: Motivation of Green Infrastructure Parcipation

# Introduction

 Due to global warming, one of the difficulties that the urban
environment face is the increase of precipitation. There is a chance
that this will lead to water pollution as the stormwater that runs
through the urban impervious surface collects pollutants and enters the
sewer system. There has been continuous effort to implement green
infrastructure to adapt to this environmental change. However there are
certain limits because this involves the voluntary participation of
individual households. This study will help understand the motivation of the participants of the past rain barrel project and help
guide environmental organizations to plan how to increase participation.

This project will analyze the motivation of households participating in the rain barrel project bby comparing contributing factors which are the education attainment and median income at the census tract level. The education attainment and income of the people participating in this project will be represented as a map. Then the shapefile of the rain barrels will be overlapped in order to analyze the demographic characteristic of households participating in the project. 




Load any required packages in a code chunk (you may need to install some packages):

#check data

#But we have to frame it


#Problem: location and time frame
#set area to Buffalo city, year should include 2015 and 2016
#area:leave and overlap with shapefile later

#Problem1: how about time frame?
#Problem2: data for Buffalo missing? How should I deal with missing values?
#maybe try again with tidycensus
